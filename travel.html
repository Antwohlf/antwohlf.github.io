            					<header class="major">
							<h3>Pittsburgh 2019<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/pittsburgh.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>At the beginning of August, I had the opportunity to go to a leadership conference in Pittsburgh with some of the other IEEE officers. It was really cool connecting with some of the tech industry's leaders hearing from them about topics like AI and virtual reality. We also had some time to go explore the city (and I tried pizza with potato slices on it???).</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>New York City 2019<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/newyorkcity.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>I technically only had 2 overnight layovers in NYC, but I took a New York taxi across Queens so I'm counting it as a visit. Landing at JFK airport was such a relieving feeling after a long 6 weeks overseas, and the city from above was breathtaking. Also, there are a surprising amount of people that sleep overnight on the floor of airports.</p>
            					<header class="major">
							<h3>London 2019<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/london.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>On one of the last weekends in Spain, I took a side trip to London to visit an old friend who also happened to be traveling around Europe. It was nice to speak English instead of using my broken Spanish, and we managed to cram a lot of fun touristy activities into a short weekend. Some of the highlights include a Shakespearean comedy at the globe theatre, riding a 2 story bus, and eating cheesecake in Hyde Park.</p>
 						<header class="major">
							<h3>Pamplona 2019<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/pamplona.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>Unfortunately, we had to leave the beach in San Sebastián behind, but thankfully there were a lot of things to do in Pamplona. The whole city felt like a summer-long party leading up to San Fermín (the running of the bulls). We also took a course about language and culture of Spain that gave me a perspective I wouldn't have gotten in America. Meeting students from the university was awesome, and I feel like I learned more Spanish in 3 weeks than I had in my 5 years of studying prior.</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Paris 2019<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/paris.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>During the transition weekend between our time in San Sebastián and Pamplona, 4 of my friends and I took a trip to Paris despite only one of us speaking any French whatsoever. The apartment we booked originally got cancelled, and the company moved us to a building that was almost a block away from the Eiffel Tower! We walked nearly 14 miles in one day, saw the Mona Lisa in person, and watched Ratatouille while drinking french wine and eating cheese and crackers. 10/10 weekend, would recommend.</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>San Sebastián 2019<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/sansebastian.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>After my little impromptu vacation in Burgos, I finally met up with my study abroad classmates and we went to San Sebastián. It is honestly the most beautiful place I have ever been, and I get all nostalgic thinking about all the time I spent on the beach with my friends. Also, every Thursday there is a thing called Pintxo Pote where the bars have a drink/snack combo for 2 euros and everyone going bar hopping. It was amazing, I still can't believe San Sebastián is real.</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Burgos 2019<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/burgos.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>Due to some cancelled flights (thanks RyanAir), I was homeless for a few days in Spain. Except not really, I ended up staying in Airbnbs and hostels in Burgos, a city that my aunt had stayed at during her study abroad in Spain. Being nearly a year out of practice with my Spanish, being alone was absolutely terrifying at first. Thankfully, the people of Burgos (especially my airbnb host, Marc) were very kind and helped me out a lot.</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>San Francisco 2019<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/sanfrancisco.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>Over spring break I had the opportunity to visit San Francisco with the university's ECE department for some company tours. It'd been nearly a decade since I last visited California, and I'd never been to the bay area. The company visits were super insightful (I was especially impressed by Intel's headquarters) and I fell in love with the city, crazy traffic and all. I will absolutely be returning some day soon (for work or vacation).</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Chicago 2018<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/chicago.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>Once I had a break from summer courses (shout out to differential equations), I went on a trip with my best friend's family to see him perform in Chicago. We don't see him too often since he moved out there to go to school for acting, but it was really awesome to catch up and have him show me around the city. Also, if for some reason you're a recruiting agent on my website, his name is Curtis Jewell and he is a fantastic singer, dancer, and actor.</p>
