								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/intro.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I was born on September 16th, 1998 in Toledo, Ohio. I grew up in Monroe, Michigan and always had a passion for science and a fascination with the latest, coolest technology. 
								I think it was partly influenced by my obsession with science fiction video games growing up, or it could have been inspired by all the times I watched the Iron Man movies 
								with my father. Either way, I came to love technology and engineering, and that’s how I found myself studying Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan. I loved the versatility
								of the major and the fact that there are infinitely many ways to improve lives through technology. I worked as a software engineering intern at Mcity, the university’s autonomous vehicle 
								test facility. I was also involved on campus as Vice President of Communications for the <a href='https://ieee.eecs.umich.edu/' style="color:cyan;outline:0;border:none" focus="outline:none" target="_blank">IEEE student branch</a>, 
								a Student Ambassador for the <a href='https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/student-life/student-ambassadors/current-ambassadors/anthony-wohlfeil/' style="color:cyan;outline:0;border:none" focus="outline:none" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department</a>, 
								and a member of MRun, the university's club running team. After completing my degree in May 2020, I joined Amazon Detroit as a Software Development Engineer. My current role at Amazon focuses on backend work to provide the best possible experience for our selling partners and developers.</p>

						<!-- Projects -->
							<article id="projects">
								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<p>My previous and current projects with a bit of context and a relevant visual.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/resume_builder.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Resume Builder</h3>
								<p>My first dive into CSS and Javascript, I'm working on a resume builder that can use different company themes to construct personalized documents.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/apartment.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Smart Apartment</h3>
								<p>After graduation, I got my own place in downtown Detroit. Outside of the typical first solo apartment decorating, I decided to make my space as smart as possible. Right now there are a total of 4 smart speakers, 8 LED light strips, and about a dozen smart switches controlling various devices in my apartment. Future plans include setting up a local MQTT network to move some of these devices off the wifi and creating a custom dashboard on an old tablet. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/file_server.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Secure File Server</h3>
								<p>The last project of my operating systems course (and my collegiate career) was a multi-threaded, secure network file server. The file server had a hierarchical file system that could contain files and directories and provided an excellent challenge in socket communications and data security.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/vm_pager.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Virtual Memory Pager</h3>
								<p>My project team for EECS 482 (Operating Systems) and I implemented a pager as part of the system's kernel to manage the virtual address spaces of processes. The main aspects of the project included support for swap backed pages, file backed pages, and moving pages in and out of physical memory for read/write commands.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/threadlibrary.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Thread Library</h3>
								<p>For my upper level operating systems course, my project group and I implemented a thread library for use on a single CPU system. The main components/objects of the library were the threads, mutexes, and condition variables (CVs).</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bullpenwebsite.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>EECS Bullpen Website</h3>
								<p>The Bullpen is an office in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science building that houses many engineering student organizations such as the <a href='https://ieee.eecs.umich.edu/' style="color:cyan;outline:0;border:none" focus="outline:none" target="_blank">Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</a>, the Society for Women Engineers (SWE), and others. In order to promote collaboration and better coordinate the various organizations' use of the space, the president of IEEE asked me to create a website for reserving the bullpen and keeping a live calendar of events. The latest version of the website can be found <a href='http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jfuher/' style="color:cyan;outline:0;border:none" focus="outline:none" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/diskscheduler.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Disk Scheduler</h3>
								<p>For my upper level operating systems course, the first project involved writing a multithreaded program that could handle and service disk requests from multiple sources. An example output from the program is shown in the picture above.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/website.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Personal Website</h3>
								<p>This website has been a fun learning experience since I started with very little experience in HTML, JS, or CSS. I started with a template from html5up.net (there are more details in the webpages' source code) and began digging through the code to modify things and make it fit my own style. The picture above depicts the old website compared to the remodeled version.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/catanalyzer.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Catanalyzer</h3>
								<p>Catanalyzer was our final project for my upper level computer vision course. The purpose was to use both deep learning and classic computer vision algorithms to analyze the state of a Settlers of Catan board from live video input and then overlay valuable information onto the video feed. This was intended as a fun supplement for experienced Catan players or a resource for new players.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/diagdefender.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Diag Defender</h3>
								<p>The Diag Defender was the final project for our embedded systems lab. It used a PixyCam mounted on the front to detect colorful objects and move the motors to chase them out of the area surrounding a block M on the ground. It also used another PixyCam with an IR sensor attachment to keep track of IR LEDs mounted on the ceiling and stay within its predetermined bounds.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mcity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Mcity Video Processor</h3>
								<p>My work at Mcity has primarily been implementing a pipeline in AWS Batch to process video footage from the self-driving shuttles. The pipeline runs a computer vision library called YOLO (You Only Look Once) with an underlying neural network called Darknet on a specified number of frames per video and uploads the labeled footage back to the source folder. Above is an example of YOLO's object detection on a picture from my first marathon.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/searchengine.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Search Engine</h3>
								<p>One of my favorite projects was also one of the biggest I've ever worked on. I was part of a team of 6 students that built a search engine from the ground up in C/C++. Greple was the result of many sleepless nights in the library and can return results from an index of over 3 million documents. My work primarily focused on the implementation of the web crawler, query parser, and constraint solver components of the engine.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/zookeeper.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Zookeeper</h3>
								<p>The Zookeeper project was practice in implementing Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms. The project was zoo themed, and this led to different scenarios like finding the most optimal route to feed the animals or the most efficient cyclical route for water distribution.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/logmanager.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Log Manager</h3>
								<p>This project mainly involved constructing a system where the user inputs a file containing log entries and then uses the program to easily filter them. These excerpt lists were constructed using timestamp, category, and/or keyword searches on the logs within the system and then returned to the user.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mineallmine.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Mine All Mine</h3>
								<p>For the Mine All Mine project, the setting is a grid (the mine) filled with rubble. The numbers in the grid represent the difficulty level of taking that path, and the goal of the project was to use a priority queue to find the path of least resistance for escaping the mine. There is also an option to have the program print relevant statistics, like the median rubble difficulty shown in the picture above.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/letterman.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Letterman</h3>
								<p>Letterman has the ability to take a custom dictionary of words as input, then uses a pathfinding algorithm to determine if there is a path between two specified words. These intermediate words have to have small differences - such as an added, subtracted, or changed letter - and must be valid words (in the context of the dictionary that the user gives).</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/piazzaclass.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Piazza Post Classifier</h3>
								<p>This Piazza post classification system was implemented using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The program takes a dataset of prelabeled Piazza posts and learns by creating connections between common keywords and their labels. Unlabeled posts can be entered into the program and it will predict the appropriate label based on what it learned during training.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/calculator.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>RPN Calculator</h3>
								<p>A Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator is one that takes the arguments first, then the operation that is to be performed on them. This is a bit difference from today's common calculators, where the operation typically goes inbetween the arguments. For example, 7+4-3 would be written in RPN as 7,4+3-. This calculator was implemented using a stack data structure that I wrote.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/euchre.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Euchre Simulator</h3>
								<p>Euchre is a very popular card game among midwesterners. This project - which has gained a bit of a reputation in the University of Michigan's EECS department - simulates a Euchre game between 4 players. It has the ability to change the computer players' strategies, and there is an option of allowing a human to play the game as well.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/resize.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Content-Aware Image Resizing</h3>
								<p>This project uses a seam-carving algorithm to calculate which pixels are the least important in an image, and then removes them. This allows the user to resize images in a way that changes the aspect ratio, but does so without distorting the image or losing valuable content.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/turbine.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Wind-Powered Turbine</h3>
								<p>My ENGR100 team fabricated a tri-bladed, savonius style wind turbine over the course of a semester. We went through the entire design process, with several reviews and prototyping stages. At the end, we brought our turbine to the roof of the Space Research Building and were able to generate enough power to support a lightbulb.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Travel</h2>
								<p>There's more to life than just Michigan.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hogwarts.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Tampa 2022</h3>
								<p>First trip of 2022 was to get away from the cold and visit some family in Tom Brady Land. I got to see a beach, visit Hogwarts, and finally see Florida for the first time. I'm sure this will be a repeat visit soon.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/la2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Los Angeles 2021</h3>
								<p>Extended visit this time. Got to do some of the things I wanted to do last time like the Hollywood Walk of Fame and seeing Griffith Observatory. Lots more In N Out was consumed this visit</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/chicago2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Chicago 2021</h3>
								<p>First trip back to the windy city since 2018, and this time I got to experience downtown. Highlights included the MSI, Shedd Aquarium, and an interactive Van Gogh art exhibit. I also got to meet up with my buddy in the city and we got Giordanos and looked at a bean. Great weekend to get out of a winter slump.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cbus.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Columbus 2020</h3>
								<p>I went to Columbus to visit a friend for gameday after they tested negative for Covid (but positive for poor football taste). I don't have many nice things to say about that school, but they do have amazing bagel sandwiches and donuts. I also felt very welcome when I walked around campus in a Michigan jersey and the entire city yelled profanities at me :)</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/la.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Los Angeles 2020</h3>
								<p>One of my close friends started grad school at UCLA, so I went to visit him for a long weekend. Thankfully the airports were pretty empty. The highlights were drinks at rooftop bar in downtown LA, spending all day on the beach in Santa Monica, and hiking to the Hollywood sign.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/mackinac.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Mackinac 2020</h3>
								<p>We took a short family weekend vacation to Mackinac to get out of the house for the first time in months. Unfortunately we didn't see the island because the ferry was packed, but we got to spend some time on the beach and I bought some delicious cherry wine. I'll be going back once everything is open again.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/nyc.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>New York City 2020</h3>
								<p>This was my first real trip to New York City. Like the previous spring break, this was a trip that I went on with the school's ECE department and we stayed in a hotel in Times Square. Some of the highlights were eating authentic New York pizza, taking a stroll around Central Park, and watching Aladdin on Broadway.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pittsburgh.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Pittsburgh 2019</h3>
								<p>At the beginning of August, I had the opportunity to go to a leadership conference in Pittsburgh with some of the other IEEE officers. It was really cool connecting with some of the tech industry's leaders hearing from them about topics like AI and virtual reality. We also had some time to go explore the city (and I tried pizza with potato slices on it???).</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/newyorkcity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>New York City 2019</h3>
								<p>I technically only had 2 overnight layovers in NYC, but I took a New York taxi across Queens so I'm counting it as a visit. Landing at JFK airport was such a relieving feeling after a long 6 weeks overseas, and the city from above was breathtaking. Also, there are a surprising amount of people that sleep overnight on the floor of airports.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/london.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>London 2019</h3>
								<p>On one of the last weekends in Spain, I took a side trip to London to visit an old friend who also happened to be traveling around Europe. It was nice to speak English instead of using my broken Spanish, and we managed to cram a lot of fun touristy activities into a short weekend. Some of the highlights include a Shakespearean comedy at the Globe Theatre, riding a 2 story bus, and eating cheesecake in Hyde Park.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pamplona.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Pamplona 2019</h3>
								<p>Unfortunately, we had to leave the beach in San Sebastián behind, but thankfully there were a lot of things to do in Pamplona. The whole city felt like a summer-long party leading up to San Fermín (the running of the bulls). We also took a course about language and culture of Spain that gave me a perspective I wouldn't have gotten in America. Meeting students from the university was awesome, and I feel like I learned more Spanish in 3 weeks than I had in my 5 years of studying prior.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/paris.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Paris 2019</h3>
								<p>During the transition weekend between our time in San Sebastián and Pamplona, 4 of my friends and I took a trip to Paris despite only one of us speaking any French whatsoever. The apartment we booked originally got cancelled, and the company moved us to a building that was almost a block away from the Eiffel Tower! We walked nearly 14 miles in one day, saw the Mona Lisa in person, and watched Ratatouille while drinking french wine and eating cheese and crackers. 10/10 weekend, would recommend.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sansebastian.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>San Sebastián 2019</h3>
								<p>After my little impromptu vacation in Burgos, I finally met up with my study abroad classmates and we went to San Sebastián. It is honestly the most beautiful place I have ever been, and I get all nostalgic thinking about all the time I spent on the beach with my friends. Also, every Thursday there is a thing called Pintxo Pote where the bars have a drink/snack combo for 2 euros and everyone going bar hopping. It was amazing, I still can't believe San Sebastián is real.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/burgos.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Burgos 2019</h3>
								<p>Due to some cancelled flights (thanks RyanAir), I was homeless for a few days in Spain. Except not really, I ended up staying in Airbnbs and hostels in Burgos, a city that my aunt had stayed at during her study abroad in Spain. Being nearly a year out of practice with my Spanish, being alone was absolutely terrifying at first. Thankfully, the people of Burgos (especially my airbnb host, Marc) were very kind and helped me out a lot.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sanfrancisco.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>San Francisco 2019</h3>
								<p>Over spring break I had the opportunity to visit San Francisco with the university's ECE department for some company tours. It'd been nearly a decade since I last visited California, and I'd never been to the bay area. The company visits were super insightful (I was especially impressed by Intel's headquarters) and I fell in love with the city, crazy traffic and all. I will absolutely be returning some day soon.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/chicago.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Chicago 2018</h3>
								<p>Once I had a break from summer courses (shout out to differential equations), I went on a trip with my best friend's family to see him perform in Chicago. We don't see him too often since he moved out there to go to school for acting, but it was really awesome to catch up and have him show me around the city. Also, if for some reason you're a recruiting agent on my website, his name is Curtis Jewell and he is a fantastic singer, dancer, and actor.</p>
