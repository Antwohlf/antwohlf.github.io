								<p>Hey, I'm Anthony. I’m a software engineer based in Michigan (Go Blue!) with a background in building/operating large-scale systems and an enthusiasm for all things tech.</p>
								<p>I previously worked as an L5 Software Development Engineer at Amazon, where I focused on backend systems for a high-traffic API platform used by selling partners + external developers. The work heavily focused on scalability, reliability, and developer experience.</p>
								<p>After Amazon, I've taken a career sabbatical to pursue personal growth and learn new technologies. I’ve been building personal projects across web platforms, automation, and data-driven tools while learning about frontend development and AI integrations. Many of these projects are documented on the <a href="#projects">Projects</a> section of this site. This period has been intentionally hands-on with a focus on learning, designing, iterating, and owning systems end-to-end.</p>
								<p>Outside of engineering, travel has been a major influence on how I think about systems, culture, and problem-solving. Experiencing different cities, languages, and ways of living has reinforced my interest in building tools that are flexible, human, and globally relevant.</p>
								<p>I’m motivated by thoughtful engineering, new perspectives, and work that compounds over time. If you're interested in working together, you can find more info about my professional experience on the <a href="#resume">Resume</a> section or reach out on the <a href="#contact">Contact</a> page.</p>

											</span>
											<p>I built Resume Revamped because I wanted a customizable resume design experience for my own job search. It lets you create highly customizable (and company-inspired) resumes with real-time interactive feedback. Building it end-to-end pushed me deeper into modern frontend development and design, while giving me hands-on experience integrating LLM-based features in a way I’d actually want to use.</p>

											</span>
											<p>One of my favorite projects was also one of the biggest I've ever worked on. I was part of a team of 6 students that built a search engine from the ground up in C/C++. Greple was the result of many sleepless nights in the library and can return results from an index of over 3 million documents. My work primarily focused on the implementation of the web crawler, query parser, and constraint solver components of the engine.</p>

											</span>
											<p>This project mainly involved constructing a system where the user inputs a file containing log entries and then uses the program to easily filter them. These excerpt lists were constructed using timestamp, category, and/or keyword searches on the logs within the system and then returned to the user.</p>

											</span>
											<p>For the Mine All Mine project, the setting is a grid (the mine) filled with rubble. The numbers in the grid represent the difficulty level of taking that path, and the goal of the project was to use a priority queue to find the path of least resistance for escaping the mine. There is also an option to have the program print relevant statistics, like the median rubble difficulty shown in the picture above.</p>

												<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/project-images/letterman.jpg" alt="" />
											</span>
											<p>Letterman has the ability to take a custom dictionary of words as input, then uses a pathfinding algorithm to determine if there is a path between two specified words. These intermediate words have to have small differences - such as an added, subtracted, or changed letter - and must be valid words (in the context of the dictionary that the user gives).</p>

												<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/project-images/piazzaclass.jpg" alt="" />
											</span>
											<p>This Piazza post classification system was implemented using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The program takes a dataset of prelabeled Piazza posts and learns by creating connections between common keywords and their labels. Unlabeled posts can be entered into the program and it will predict the appropriate label based on what it learned during training.</p>

												<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/project-images/calculator.jpg" alt="" />
											</span>
											<p>A Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator is one that takes the arguments first, then the operation that is to be performed on them. This is a bit difference from today's common calculators, where the operation typically goes inbetween the arguments. For example, 7+4-3 would be written in RPN as 7,4+3-. This calculator was implemented using a stack data structure that I wrote.</p>

												<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/project-images/euchre.jpg" alt="" />
											</span>
											<p>Euchre is a very popular card game among midwesterners. This project - which has gained a bit of a reputation in the University of Michigan's EECS department - simulates a Euchre game between 4 players. It has the ability to change the computer players' strategies, and there is an option of allowing a human to play the game as well.</p>

										<div class="project-card" data-skills-languages="C, C++">
											<h2>Content-Aware Image Resizing</h2>
											<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
												<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/project-images/resize.jpg" alt="" />
											</span>
											<p>This project uses a seam-carving algorithm to calculate which pixels are the least important in an image, and then removes them. This allows the user to resize images in a way that changes the aspect ratio, but does so without distorting the image or losing valuable content.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="project-card">
											<h2>Wind-Powered Turbine</h2>
											<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
												<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/project-images/turbine.jpg" alt="" />
											</span>
											<p>My ENGR100 team fabricated a tri-bladed, savonius style wind turbine over the course of a semester. We went through the entire design process, with several reviews and prototyping stages. At the end, we brought our turbine to the roof of the Space Research Building and were able to generate enough power to support a lightbulb.</p>

							   <p>It had been far too long without a visit to my favorite city. I saw one of my favorite artists (Dua Lipa), another broadway show (The Lion King), and tried some of the best tacos/pizza I've ever had. 10/10, no complaints.</p>
							   
							   <h3>Austin</h3>
                               <span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">

                               </span>
							   <p>My first visit to Texas was a weekend trip with my Longhorn friend and all of his hometown/college buddies. Scorching heat, mouth-watering BBQ + tacos, and a diehard football cult - Austin lived up to expectations.</p>

							   <h3>San Juan</h3>
                               <span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">

                               </span>
							   <p>An unexpected trip to Puerto Rico with some friends to see one of the shows in Bad Bunny's PR residency. The beach was beautiful, the people were kind, and the music was amazing - I love Puerto Rico.</p>
							   
							   <h3>Chicago</h3>
                               <span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">

                               </span>
                               <p>This one was a quick trip out to Chicago for a Linkin Park concert my friend and I won lottery tickets to. The morning after we ended up meeting with another old friend of ours and enjoying the nice weather at Lincoln Park Zoo.</p>
                              
                               <h3>Northern Michigan / Cadillac</h3>

                               </span>
                               <p>Bachelor party weekend for my childhood best friend. We rented a big cabin outside of Cadillac, MI and had a weekend filled with great food, dive bars, and bonfires.</p>
                              
                               <h3>Northern Michigan / Cheboygan</h3>
                               <span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">

                               </span>
                               <p>This one was a big group trip up to friend's family cabin for a "boy's trip" weekend. We spent a lot of time outside, at a local watering hole, and took a day trip to Cheboygan to check out my favorite brewery.</p>  

								<h3>Portland</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/portland4.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Super quick turnaround for this Portland trip, but it was worth it for a bar crawl birthday party and spending more time with the new friends I met on the last visit.</p>
								
								<h3>Detroit</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/detroit2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>It's been a while since I had a staycation in Detroit, and this one was for The Weeknd concert. I spent the weekend exploring bars in midtown, enjoying the bustling downtown, and hitting some of my favorite food spots.</p>

								<h3>Louisville</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/louisville2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>A long weekend road trip with my brother to visit our cousins in Louisville. We grilled, went to the Jim Bean Distillery, and explored a bunch of shops and restaurants around the city and surrounding area.</p>

								<h3>Seattle / Easton</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/seattle.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>We made a quick day trip out of Seattle on our way to Easton for a friend's big birthday weekend. The weekend included lots of party games, a rafting trip, and lots of good food and drink with 20+ new friends.</p>

								<h3>Portland</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/portland3.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>This Portland trip included all the usual suspects - the Japan boys, a trip to 10 barrel, and an uphill slop run with Portland Running Co.</p>
								
								<h3>Phoenix</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/phoenix2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Red eye flights were cheap, so I flew out west on easter weekend to visit my family and some friends out that way. The weather was beautiful, the food was good - no complaints.</p>

								<h3>Frankenmuth</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/frankenmuth3.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Family weekend at our favorite place, this time with a brand new expanded waterpark. The adult swim up bar and abundance of waterslides was insane, I can't wait to go back later this year.</p>

								<h3>Chicago</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/chicago10.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Round 3 of St Patrick's Day in Chicago. It was a smaller group this year, but still an enjoyable time and the weather was unseasonably nice.</p>

								<h3>Bend</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/bend.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I was invited to the Portland gang's annual ski trip out in Bend, Oregon. We stayed in a big cabin with beautiful scenery, played a lot of games, and I went skiing for the first time!</p>

								<h3>Portland</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/portland2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Back to Portland, this time to visit some friends before we all went on a ski trip in Bend. I spent a lot more time downtown this visit, and still was able to get in some running / exploring.</p>

								<h3>Tampa</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/tampa.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I needed to get away from the depressing Michigan winter, so I took my annual trip down to Florida to visit my aunt. This was a more chill trip, but we still went to the beach, a nationally ranked pizza restaurant, and the Florida Aquarium in downtown Tampa</p>

								<h3>Barcelona</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/barcelona.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I reunited with some friends after 5 years and stayed at their apartment in Barcelona. I toured the city, visited La Sagrada Familia, and had Spanish paella near the beach. Barcelona is competing with San Sebastian for my favorite city in Europe.</p>

								<h3>Madrid</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/madrid.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I spent the first day of Madrid very sick, and the cold rainy weather did not help with that. I did get to explore the city on a nicer, healthier day and grab dinner with a friend that I met in Japan last year. I spent a lot of this section of the trip walking around and reliving the experiences I had while I was studying abroad in Spain.</p>

								<h3>Prague</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/prague.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>The Madhouse hostel lived up to its name - it was the most social and chaotic environments I've ever been in. Outside of the hostel activities, I was able to explore a truly breathtaking city and it looked like something out of a fairytale.</p>

								<h3>Amsterdam</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/amsterdam.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Amsterdam was a quieter part of the trip for me. I made some Swiss and Australian friends at the hostel, went to a lot of museums (including the breathtaking Van Gogh museum), and somehow ended up at karaoke 3 nights in a row. This will be another one to visit in the summer for sure.</p>

								<h3>Zurich</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/zurich.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>We started off 2025 with a big solo trip to Europe. Stop #1 was in Zurich to visit an old friend after many years. The city was cold - but beautiful - and I can only imagine how wonderful it will be when I visit in the summer.</p>

								<h3>Madison</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/madison.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Unfortunate circumstances cancelled the plans I had originally for this trip, but I still made the best of it as a solo adventure. I tried a bunch of local bars, made some new friends, and took myself on a tour of Wisconsin's beautiful campus.</p>								

								<h3>South Bend</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/southbend.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>A good friend of mine graduated from Notre Dame, so when they hosted the first round of the college football playoffs I had to go visit. We tailgated with amazing food and then met some interesting ND/IU alumni at a busy bar next to the stadium.</p>
								
								<h3>Leavenworth</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/leavenworth.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>We rented a big cabin on a lake for my friend's birthday weekend just outside of Leavenworth WA, and the nature was breathtaking. Leavenworth is a cozy bavarian town that felt like a larger Frankenmuth up in the mountains - I hope to be back someday.</p>

								<h3>Portland</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/portland.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>My first trip to the PNW included a long muddy run in the mountains, a super fun improv comedy show, and a tour of the Nike headquarters </p>
								
								<h3>New York City (Fall)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/nyc6.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>This trip felt different in a good way, the city felt more familiar and I had a great time showing my brother around. Other highlights include dinner with some friends, Saw the (parody) Musical, and this breathtaking view.</p>

								<h3>Asbury Park</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/asburypark.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>This was a little side quest before NYC to catch up with an old friend and finally visit NJ for the first time. Asbury Park was a cute little beach town and I could definitely see myself visiting again in the future.</p>
								
								<h3>Chicago (Fall)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/chicago9.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I ended up staying in a completely new (to me) area on the west side of Chicago. I caught up with some old friends, saw a broadway performance, and watched the Michigan-MSU game at an alumni bar.</p>

								<h3>Brooklyn / New York</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/nyc5.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>A last minute trip with my best friend to see our favorite childhood band, Linkin Park. I couldn't ask for a better birthday.</p>
								
								<h3>Hakone</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/hakone.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>The only goal of visiting Hakone was to go to an authentic Japanese Onsen, and this one was (supposedly) tattoo / foreigner friendly. While the welcome was lukewarm at best, the experience was real and very much worth the trip. The bus ride home through the rainy mountains/forest felt like something out of a lo-fi video, and I couldn't get enough of it.</p>

								<h3>Kyoto</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/kyoto.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
							    <p>Kyoto was under-budgeted in terms of time, but we were able to make the best of it with our day trip. We took a class on Japanese knives (and got our own customized ones) up in the mountains and then came down to the city for a delicious wagyu meal and a couple drinks at a world famous bar.</p>

								<h3>Nara</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/nara.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Nara is known for its beautiful temples and extremely friendly deer population - it delivered on both. 10/10 no notes</p>

								<h3>Osaka</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/osaka.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>This section of the Japan trip included a visit to the world's largest aquarium, a professional Japanese baseball game, and a guided tour through the city's bars and restaurants.</p>

								<h3>Tokyo</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/tokyo.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>An unexpected bump to business class gave my first trip to Asia (a 14 hour flight) an extremely pleasant start. Tokyo is beautiful, efficient, and odd in all of the best ways. It feels like an alternate version of New York and I love it for that.</p>
								
								<h3> Chicago (Summer)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/chicago8.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Another year, another fun Lollapalooza and some lovely summer evenings in the city. Hozier summoned a thunderstorm during his set and Chappell Roan may have a larger following than both presidential candidates at this point.</p>
								
								<h3> Frankenmuth (Summer)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/frankenmuth2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>This weekend away was a small pocket of peace in a busy and tragic summer for my family.</p>
								
								<h3>Traverse City</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/tc.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>After a Hozier concert, me and a few friends took a last minute trip up to Traverse City. We walked around town, played board games in an Airbnb, and then some of us went camping after. It was a very lovely long weekend.</p>

								<h3>New York City (Spring)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/nyc4.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I think it's a rule now that I can't book a NYC trip more than a week in advance. As always, this trip had lots of walking through central park, a broadway show (Book of Mormon), and a visit to a museum (the MET).</p>

								<h3>Los Angeles</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/la3.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>This was a long overdue return trip to Santa Monica/Los Angeles. Highlights included seeing the Michigan women's basketball team play in March Madness, going to Griffith Observatory, and a couple beach front runs in the sun.</p>								
								
								<h3>Chicago (Winter)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/chicago7.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I realized during this St Paddys trip that I really only visit during the cold months, and that feels like a crime. I should make a point to visit Chicago during the summer months, maybe an extended stay.</p>
								
								<h3>New York City (Winter)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/nyc3.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>In typical Anthony fashion, this weekend trip was booked on Sunday of the same week. I met up with an old friend from Spain, saw another Broadway show (Sweeney Todd), and visited the Museum of Modern Art on this trip - no complaints here.</p>

								<h3>Clearwater</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/clearwater2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>A quick trip to Florida to enjoy some sun and take my first visit to Disney World. I spent way too much money on creating a lightsaber - and it was worth every penny.</p>

								<h3>Frankenmuth (Winter)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/frankenmuth.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>A last minute staycation in my favorite cozy Michigan town for the holiday weekend. I have been to Frankenmuth at least 25 times in my life, and now as an adult I get to enjoy the restaurants, drinks, and adults-only areas of the town.</p>

								<h3>Boston (Winter)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/boston2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Back to Boston to ring in the new year. I met a lot of new wonderful people and got to watch a Michigan Rose Bowl win at an alumni bar in downtown Boston - can't complain much.</p>

								<h3>Indianapolis</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/indy.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>A last minute trip to Indy with a group of friends for the Big10 Championship game was a fantastic decision. Wolverines must travel well, because it felt like a home game in that audience.</p>

								<h3>Detroit</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/detroit.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
 								<p>We had a nice little staycation in a restored mansion suite, and were lucky enough to have unseasonably nice weather (50s and sunny) for the whole trip. There were too many highlights to list, but watching Michigan's 1000th win and getting drinks at the top of the renaissance center have to be up there.</p>								

								<h3>Rome</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/rome.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>This was my first time in Italy and it was beautiful. I had some of the best pizza, pasta, and wine of my life and got to enjoy breathtaking views around the historic city.</p>

								<h3>London</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/london2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>My second time around London was a lot less chaotic. We stayed at a cozy pub/hostel, walked many miles around the city, and saw Wicked on Broadway.</p>
								
								<h3>Boston (Fall)</h3>

								</span>
								<p>A 9 hour layover in Boston gave us enough time to hop off the plane for a lovely sandwich and a walk around the north side.</p>
								
								<h3>Northern Michigan</h3>

								</span>
								<p>A long weekend trip with the family up north was a much needed disconnect during the busiest time of the year.</p>								

								<h3>Chicago (Summer)</h3>

									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/chicago6.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Purchasing a home (finally, after a year of looking) put my travels on pause for a bit, but getting back into it with a friend's birthday weekend and Lolla trip out in the windy city.</p>
								
								<h3>Clearwater</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/clearwater.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>A little work-cation with some beach time, some imported Mexican beers, and my first taste of gator.</p>

								<h3>Chicago (Spring)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/chicago5.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I seem to be in Chicago a lot these days, and I'm really coming to love and appreciate the city. There were a lot of wonderful experiences this St Paddy's weekend, but the most impactful was a peaceful run along Lakefront Trail.</p>
								
								<h3>Orlando</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/orlando.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Another unexpected trip, but a very welcome one. I returned to Universal Studios almost exactly a year after my first trip, and stayed in a nice resort with my family in a town nearby.</p>
								
								<h3>Chicago (Winter)</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/chicago4.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Some very last minute plans found me and 8 of my closest friends packed in a small apartment for new years weekend. It was a fantastic weekend full of good food, fun bars, and lots of games/jokes. Probably my favorite new years in recent memory, and I'll likely be back for St Patty's in a couple months.</p>

								<h3>Chicago</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/chicago3.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>The Ann Arbor → Chicago pipeline is real, and it was nice to visit an old friend, meet some new people, and eat lots of good food on this weekend getaway. This blurry picture was taken at Other Side Bar, a cozy bar connected to a pasta restaurant - not sure what more you can ask for.</p>
								
								<h3>New York City</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/nyc2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Back to the city, this time with a friend. Saw another fantastic Broadway show (Hadestown), had some amazing bagel sandwiches and pizza, and spent a lot of time walking around central park. Might try the city for a couple weeks next time.</p>
								
								<h3>Mackinac</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/mackinac2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Back to Mackinac post-pandemic to visit my archeologist friend working at Fort Michilimackinac. The weekend included a day trip to Tahquamenon Falls, a ferry to the island, and lots of fudge.</p>
								
								<h3>Gatlinburg</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/tennessee.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>My dad's side of the family rented a cabin in the Smokey Mountains for a couple days. With a pool, hot tub, fireplace, and game room - we didn't really have any reason to leave. We did go out for some Tennessee moonshine and a trip to Ripley's Aquarium though.</p>
								
								<h3>Louisville</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/louisville.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I didn't spend too long in Louisville as I was visiting family in the surrounding cities, but I ended up going to a very cool video game arcade bar called Hideaway Saloon.</p>
								
								<h3>Phoenix</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/phoenix.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Back to the desert for the first time since 2017 to visit my family. I was happy to get some sun, hit a couple arcades (including the super cool <a href="https://www.starfightersarcade.com/" style="color:cyan;outline:0;border:none" focus="outline:none" target="_blank">Starfighters Arcade</a>), and drink good margaritas.</p>
								
								<h3>Tampa</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/hogwarts.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>First trip of 2022 was to get away from the cold and visit some family in Tom Brady Land. I got to see a beach, visit Hogwarts, and finally see Florida for the first time. I'm sure this will be a repeat visit soon.</p>

								</span>
								<p>Extended visit this time. Got to do some of the things I wanted to do last time like the Hollywood Walk of Fame and seeing Griffith Observatory. Lots more In N Out was consumed this visit</p>
								
								<h3>Chicago</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/chicago2.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>First trip back to the windy city since 2018, and this time I got to experience downtown. Highlights included the MSI, Shedd Aquarium, and an interactive Van Gogh art exhibit. I also got to meet up with my buddy in the city and we got Giordanos and looked at a bean. Great weekend to get out of a winter slump.</p>

								<h3>Columbus</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/cbus.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I went to Columbus to visit a friend for gameday after they tested negative for Covid (but positive for poor football taste). I don't have many nice things to say about that school, but they do have amazing bagel sandwiches and donuts. I also felt very welcome when I walked around campus in a Michigan jersey and the entire city yelled profanities at me :)</p>
								
								<h3>Los Angeles</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/la.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>One of my close friends started grad school at UCLA, so I went to visit him for a long weekend. Thankfully the airports were pretty empty. The highlights were drinks at rooftop bar in downtown LA, spending all day on the beach in Santa Monica, and hiking to the Hollywood sign.</p>
								
								<h3>Mackinac</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/mackinac.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>We took a short family weekend vacation to Mackinac to get out of the house for the first time in months. Unfortunately we didn't see the island because the ferry was packed, but we got to spend some time on the beach and I bought some delicious cherry wine. I'll be going back once everything is open again.</p>
								
								<h3>New York City</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/nyc.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>This was my first real trip to New York City. Like the previous spring break, this was a trip that I went on with the school's ECE department and we stayed in a hotel in Times Square. Some of the highlights were eating authentic New York pizza, taking a stroll around Central Park, and watching Aladdin on Broadway.</p>

								<h3>Pittsburgh</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/pittsburgh.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>At the beginning of August, I had the opportunity to go to a leadership conference in Pittsburgh with some of the other IEEE officers. It was really cool connecting with some of the tech industry's leaders hearing from them about topics like AI and virtual reality. We also had some time to go explore the city (and I tried pizza with potato slices on it???).</p>
								
								<h3>New York City</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/newyorkcity.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>I technically only had 2 overnight layovers in NYC, but I took a New York taxi across Queens and slept on airport floors so I'm counting it as a visit. Landing at JFK airport was such a relieving feeling after a long 6 weeks overseas, and the city from above was breathtaking. Also, there are a surprising amount of people that sleep overnight on the floor of airports.</p>
								
								<h3>London</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/london.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>On one of the last weekends in Spain, I took a side trip to London to visit an old friend who also happened to be traveling around Europe. It was nice to speak English instead of using my broken Spanish, and we managed to cram a lot of fun touristy activities into a short weekend. Some of the highlights include a Shakespearean comedy at the Globe Theatre, riding a 2 story bus, and eating cheesecake in Hyde Park.</p>
								
								<h3>Pamplona</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/pamplona.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Unfortunately, we had to leave the beach in San Sebastián behind, but thankfully there were a lot of things to do in Pamplona. The whole city felt like a summer-long party leading up to San Fermín (the running of the bulls). We also took a course about language and culture of Spain that gave me a perspective I wouldn't have gotten in America. Meeting students from the university was awesome, and I feel like I learned more Spanish in 3 weeks than I had in my 5 years of studying prior.</p>
								
								<h3>Paris</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/paris.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>During the transition weekend between our time in San Sebastián and Pamplona, 4 of my friends and I took a trip to Paris despite only one of us speaking any French whatsoever. The apartment we booked originally got cancelled, and the company moved us to a building that was almost a block away from the Eiffel Tower! We walked nearly 14 miles in one day, saw the Mona Lisa in person, and watched Ratatouille while drinking French wine and eating cheese and crackers. 10/10 weekend, would recommend.</p>
								
								<h3>San Sebastián</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/sansebastian.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>After my little impromptu vacation in Burgos, I finally met up with my study abroad classmates and we went to San Sebastián. It is honestly the most beautiful place I have ever been, and I get all nostalgic thinking about all the time I spent on the beach with my friends. Also, every Thursday there is a thing called Pintxo Pote where the bars have a drink/snack combo for 2 euros and everyone going bar hopping. It was amazing, I still can't believe San Sebastián is real.</p>
								
								<h3>Burgos</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/burgos.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Due to some cancelled flights (thanks RyanAir), I was homeless for a few days in Spain. Except not really, I ended up staying in Airbnbs and hostels in Burgos, a city that my aunt had stayed at during her study abroad in Spain. Being nearly a year out of practice with my Spanish, being alone was absolutely terrifying at first. Thankfully, the people of Burgos (especially my airbnb host, Marc) were very kind and helped me out a lot.</p>
								
								<h3>San Francisco</h3>
								<span class="image main" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">
									<img src="https://uqmjvvghhhtjqbzzvtop.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/personal-website/location-images/sanfrancisco.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>
								<p>Over spring break I had the opportunity to visit San Francisco with the university's ECE department for some company tours. It'd been nearly a decade since I last visited California, and I'd never been to the bay area. The company visits were super insightful (I was especially impressed by Intel's headquarters) and I fell in love with the city, crazy traffic and all. I will absolutely be returning some day soon.</p>

								</span>
								<p>Once I had a break from summer courses (read: was freed from differential equations), I went on a trip with my best friend's family to see him perform in Chicago. We don't see him too often since he moved out there to go to school for acting, but it was really awesome to catch up and have him show me around the city. Also, if for some reason you're a recruiting agent on my website, his name is Curtis Jewell and he is a fantastic singer, dancer, and actor.</p>
