								<h2><strong>"...medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for."</strong></h2>
                                <p>-- Robin Williams, Dead Poet's Society</p>

                                <p>These examples of art, literature, architecture, and engineering are some of my favorites. There is no rhyme or reason to this section, other than to share pieces that inspire me to be creative and motivated.</p>

								<h3>Da Vinci's Anatomical Sketches</h3>
                                <span class="image"><img src="https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/evaamsen/files/2019/05/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Anatomical_studies_of_the_shoulder_-_WGA12824.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200" alt="" width="600" height="300"></span>
                                <p>Leonardo Da Vinci was the archetype of a renaissance man. His study of anatomy and physiology combined with his artistic talent allowed him to create highly detailed drawings of the human body from the inside out. This is a perfect example of how one person can create at the intersection of science and art.</p>

                                <h3>The Story of Icarus</h3>
                                <span class="image"><img src="https://www.creativefabrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/29/John-Singer-Sargents-Icarus-39538689-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="300"></span>
                                <p>The story of Daedalus and his son, Icarus, is one of my favorites in Greek mythology. The inventive genius of Daedalus and the symbolism of flying too close to the sun make this story very memorable, along with its cultural impact in art and the popular saying "flew too close to the sun".</p>

                                <h3>Japanese Gardens</h3>
                                <span class="image"><img src="https://www.gardendesign.com/pictures/images/900x705Max/site_3/zen-garden-japanese-garden-raked-gravel-garden-shutterstock-com_15666.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300"></span>
                                <p>Japanese gardens are well known for their tranquility and serenity. The water, bridges, stones, and fish all are symbolic in Japanese culture and contribute to a calming and beautiful environment. I hope to have a Japanese style garden in my home one day.</p>

                                <h3>Bobbie Carlyle's Self Made Man</h3>
                                <span class="image"><img src="https://www.aongking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/self-made-man-statue-in-bronze-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300"></span>
                                <p>"Man cannot remake himself without suffering, for he is both the marble and the sculptor." --Alexis Carrel</p>
                                <p>This piece speaks to me for 2 reasons. The first is because sculptors can see a large slab of rock and visualize a stone person (or other subject) inside of it - it's like an artist viewing a blank canvas but in a third dimension. The other part of this that I appreciate goes with the quote above - the idea that man is self made and the product of his own work. If something is to be changed in the final piece, the subject is holding the tools to make it so.</p>

                                <h3>Van Gogh's The Starry Night</h3>
                                <span class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg/1920px-Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300"></span>
                                <p>A timeless painting, and the only one on this list that I've seen in person (so far). The colors, patterns, and quiet vibe of this painting make it my favorite - it was a memorable experience to see at one of the interactive Van Gogh exhibits in Chicago.</p>

                                <h3>La La Land</h3>
                                <span class="image"><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/678/8b4/3efde8f254542d9039e64ad2bb21964ba6-23-lalaland-yellow-dress.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="300"></span>
                                <p>"Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire." --Gustav Mahler</p>
                                <p>Much more modern than the rest of these pieces, but this movie has powerful messagse in modernization vs. tradition, self expression, and the reality that things don't work out the way we think they should. It's seen by many as just a musical, or a meme from an awards show - but it's one of my favorite movies.</p>
