							<h2>Projects</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Here are some projects I've worked on over the past few years. Many were for my courses at the university, but there are also some work and personal projects as well. The more recent/ongoing projects are near the top of the page.</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Mcity Video Processor<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/mcity.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>My work at Mcity has primarily been implementing a pipeline in AWS Batch to process video footage from the self-driving shuttles. The pipeline runs a computer vision library called YOLO (You Only Look Once) with an underlying neural network called Darknet on a specified number of frames per video and uploads the labeled footage back to the source folder. On the right is an example of YOLO's object detection on a picture from my first marathon.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Personal Website<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/website.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>This website has been a fun learning experience since I started with very little experience in HTML, JS, or CSS. I started with a template from html5up.net (there are more details in the webpages' source code) and began digging through the code to modify things and make it fit my own style. One of the more interesting parts of the project was figuring out the Google Maps API to get a custom map of Ann Arbor embedded on the home page.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Search Engine<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/searchengine.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>One of my favorite projects was also one of the biggest I've ever worked on. I was part of a team of 6 students that built a search engine from the ground up in C/C++. Greple was the result of many sleepless nights in the library and can return results from an index of over 3 million documents. My work primarily focused on the implementation of the web crawler, query parser, and constraint solver components of the engine.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Zookeeper<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/zookeeper.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>The Zookeeper project was practice in implementing Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms. The project was zoo themed, and this led to different scenarios like finding the most optimal route to feed the animals or the most efficient cyclical route for water distribution.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Log Manager<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/logmanager.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header> 
						<p>This project mainly involved constructing a system where the user inputs a file containing log entries and then uses the program to easily filter them. These excerpt lists were constructed using timestamp, category, and/or keyword searches on the logs within the system and then returned to the user.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Mine All Mine<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/mineallmine.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>For the Mine All Mine project, the setting is a grid (the mine) filled with rubble. The numbers in the grid represent the difficulty level of taking that path, and the goal of the project was to use a priority queue to find the path of least resistance for escaping the mine. There is also an option to have the program print relevant statistics, like the median rubble difficulty shown in the picture on the right.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Letterman<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/letterman.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header> 
						<p>Letterman has the ability to take a custom dictionary of words as input, then uses a pathfinding algorithm to determine if there is a path between two specified words. These intermediate words have to have small differences - such as an added, subtracted, or changed letter - and must be valid words (in the context of the dictionary that the user gives).</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Piazza Post Classifier<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/piazzaclass.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>This Piazza post classification system was implemented using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The program takes a dataset of prelabeled Piazza posts and learns by creating connections between common keywords and their labels. Unlabeled posts can be entered into the program and it will predict the appropriate label based on what it learned during training.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>RPN Calculator<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/calculator.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>A Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator is one that takes the arguments first, then the operation that is to be performed on them. This is a bit difference from today's common calculators, where the operation typically goes inbetween the arguments. For example, 7+4-3 would be written in RPN as 7,4+3-. This calculator was implemented using a stack data structure that I wrote.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Euchre Simulator<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/euchre.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>Euchre is a very popular card game among midwesterners. This project - which has gained a bit of a reputation in the University of Michigan's EECS department - simulates a Euchre game between 4 players. It has the ability to change the computer players' strategies, and there is an option of allowing a human to play the game as well.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Content-Aware Image Resizing<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/resize.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>This project uses a seam-carving algorithm to calculate which pixels are the least important in an image, and then removes them. This allows the user to resize images in a way that changes the aspect ratio, but does so without distorting the image or losing valuable content.</p>
						
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Wind-Powered Turbine<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/turbine.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header> 
						<p>My ENGR100 team fabricated a tri-bladed, savonius style wind turbine over the course of a semester. We went through the entire design process, with several reviews and prototyping stages. At the end, we brought our turbine to the roof of the Space Research Building and were able to generate enough power to support a lightbulb.</p>
