							<h2>Projects</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Here are some projects I've worked on over the past few years. Many were for my courses at the university, there are also some work/personal projects as well. The more recent/ongoing projects are at the top of the page.</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Mcity Video Processor<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/mcity.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>My work at Mcity has primarily been implementing a pipeline in AWS Batch to process video footage from the self-driving shuttles. The pipeline runs a library called YOLO (You Only Look Once) with an underlying neural network called Darknet on a specified number of frames per video and uploads it back to the source folder. The image on the right is an example of YOLO/Darknet's labeling capability on a picture of me after my first marathon.</p>

							<h3>Personal Website<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/website.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>This website has been a lot of fun to work on since I started with very little experience in HTML, JS, or CSS. I began using a template from html5up.com (there are more details in the webpages' source code) and began digging through the code to modify things and make it fit my own style. I also had quite a time figuring out the Google Maps API to get that embedded on the home page. </p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Search Engine<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/searchengine.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>One of my favorite projects was also one of the biggest. I was part of a team of 6 students that built a search engine from the ground up in C/C++. Greple was the result of many sleepless nights in the library and can return results from an index of over 3 million documents. My work primarily focused on the implementation of the web crawler, query parser, and constraint solver components.</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Zookeeper<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/zookeeper.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>The Zookeeper project was practice in working with Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms. The project was zoo themed and the sections revolved around finding the most optimal routes to feed the animals or the most efficient cyclical route for water distribution.</p>
						<header class="major">
							<h3>Log Manager<span class="image right"><img src="images/fulls/logmanager.jpg" alt=""></span></h3>
						</header> 
						<p>This project mainly involved constructing a system where the user inputs a file containing log entries and has the ability to easily search through them. These excerpt lists were constructed using timestamp, category, and/or keyword searches on the logs within the system and then returned to the user.</p>
