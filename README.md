# Anthony Wohlfeil — Personal Website

This is my personal website - built to share the work I do professionally, the projects I build in my spare time, and the travel that shapes who I am. The site is intentionally personal rather than purely a portfolio: each section reflects something I’ve learned, built, or experienced along my journey. I keep it updated as a living snapshot of what I’m working on and what I care about. Everything here is included because it is important to me, so feel free to take a look around and send me a message.
